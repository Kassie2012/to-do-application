# To - Do List Application

This is a To - Do List applicaton that is simple and easy to use, you are able to add in multiple task at once and it will organize it for you numerically. 

There are four commands:
1. View Task
2. Add Task
3. Delete Task
4. End To - Do List

Each should work, I had some difficulties with the add feature and it freezing when trying to add more than one item but had Mr. Daniel help me figure it out. I also had problems with deleting a task but i believe i figured it out as well.
